### Description 
An anime face generator based on DCGAN and implemented by TensorFlow.

### Data 
As you can see, `./data` folder is an empty folder. But you can download data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OmuwXUBEz15BeDNi1t4S8kp-TEOL4fLb?usp=sharing). Please put the zipped dataset into `./data` and then unzip all the files.

### Usage
`RunFullDataSet.ipynb` is the main file. The reason why it's a ipynb file is I want to use Google colab GPU. So the easiest way to run code is to use Google Colab.
